# BankApp
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
In this project I think I did well using the pointer and the calls. I was worried that I would use them wrong when trying to call specific inputs in different functions.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There are so many parts that I would enhance. If I had more time and more confidence I would have added options to design and have a better lay out so it doesn't look so plain and boring. I would have added headers and more in details. I would have also liked to go through and allow it to be down to the month rather than year.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Honestly I struggled with a lot of this project. The outputs and the math were easy it was making sure that how I had it written would return the correct code. I struggled with making sure the inputs were correct especially when you had to take multiples inputs at different times. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Building a flow chart and psuedocard are something that will definitely be helpfully. I was able to break the whole problem down and work on it bit by bit. It allowed me to work on the different functions then go through and do some studying on what I was missing to go back and tie everything together. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable readable and adaptable by trying to allow the function to be morphable and usable by other programmers. I beleive it was readable by adding my notes on what every function did.
